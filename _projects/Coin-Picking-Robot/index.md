## Robot Circuitry
{% include image-gallery.html images="RobotCircuit.jpg" height="400" %}

The main modules of the robot circuitry include:
- Optocouplers for noise isolation between noisy components (motors, electromagnet, etc.) and sensitive components (microcontroller, sensors)
- H-Bridge transistor configurations for motor control
- Servo and electromagnet arm as the coin picking mechanism

## Coin and Perimeter Detection
{% include image-gallery.html images="RobotBottom.jpg" height="400" %}

Depicted is the coin detection and perimeter detection inductors.

The Colpitts oscillator coin detection system works by detecting frequency changes in an LC circuit. As a coin gets closet to the inductor, it affects the inductors magnetic field and changes its effective inductance, this causes a change in the frequency of oscillation which can be detected by using the micrcontrollers ADC. Once the frequency meets a certain threshold, the robot stops and the coin picking mechanism is executed. 

The perimeter detection system works through using a LC circuit to detect the time-varying magenetic field generated by the AC wire perimeter. The induced voltage in the circuit in applified by a gain op-amp and fed into a peak detector circuit which sends the peak voltage (rectified DC) to the micrcontrollers ADC pin where its value can be compared with a threshold value. Two inductors perpendicular to eachother are used to avoid getting stuck in corners. Once reached, the robot turns away from the perimeter at a randomized angle. 

## Ultrasonic Sensing

As a bonus feature to the project, I added an ultrasonic sensor to the  robot to detect objects in its path, even if its not the perimeter which enhances the total robustness of the autonomous navigation. The sensor works by sending ultrasonic waves and measuring the time it takes to receive the wave back. This time can be then be converted to distance. If the robot gets to close to an object, it turns away at a random angle.
